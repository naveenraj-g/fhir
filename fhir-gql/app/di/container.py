"""
Root dependency-injection container for the entire application.

This module defines the top-level `Container` class using the dependency-injector
library's declarative container pattern. It acts as the composition root — every
service, repository, and client in the application is wired here so that:
  - Dependencies are assembled once at startup rather than on every request.
  - The dependency graph is explicit and testable: replacing a provider (e.g. with
    a mock) requires changing one line here rather than hunting call sites.
  - FastAPI route handlers receive pre-built service instances via Depends() without
    knowing how those instances are constructed.

Wiring:
    WiringConfiguration(packages=["app"]) tells dependency-injector to scan every
    module under the `app` package at startup and inject providers wherever it finds
    the @inject decorator combined with Provide[Container.*] type hints. This avoids
    manually listing every injected module.

    Application-wide DI container. Instantiated once in app.main and attached to
    `app.container` so it survives for the full process lifetime.

    Sub-containers are declared as `providers.Container(...)` which creates a
    lazily-initialised child container. Passing `core=core` to each domain container
    wires the shared CoreContainer instance into the child so its providers
    (e.g. fhir_client) can be referenced via `core.fhir_client` inside the child.
