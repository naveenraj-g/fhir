"""
API router for FHIR Organisation resources.

Exposes CRUD endpoints under /organizations. Each handler is intentionally thin:
it validates the schema (Pydantic), calls the service, and returns the formatted
response. All business logic lives in OrganizationsService.

Content negotiation:
    Every handler that returns a body accepts a `request: Request` parameter so it
    can read the client's Accept header and forward it through the service/client
    layers to the FHIR Server. The FHIR Server performs the actual format
    transformation (plain JSON ↔ FHIR R4). The handler wraps the result in a
    JSONResponse with the matching Content-Type via format_response().

    Clients signal their preferred format via:
        Accept: application/fhir+json    → FHIR R4 Organization / Bundle
        Accept: application/json         → Plain JSON (default)

OpenAPI docs:
    Both response schemas (plain and FHIR R4) are documented in the `responses`
    dict so Swagger UI shows the full contract for each format. `response_model` is
    intentionally omitted from the decorators because the handlers return JSONResponse
    directly — FastAPI bypasses response_model validation for JSONResponse returns,
    and the schema documentation is fully covered by the explicit `responses` entries.
