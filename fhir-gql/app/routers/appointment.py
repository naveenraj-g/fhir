"""
FastAPI router for Appointment resources.

Endpoints:
  POST   /appointments/book          — simplified booking: validate slot, create Appointment, mark Slot busy
  POST   /appointments/              — create a new Appointment (with all child arrays in body)
  GET    /appointments/me            — caller's own appointments (paginated, from JWT)
  GET    /appointments/{id}          — fetch a single Appointment by integer ID
  GET    /appointments/              — paginated list with optional filters
  PATCH  /appointments/{id}          — partial update (scalar fields only — arrays immutable)
  DELETE /appointments/{id}          — permanent delete (cascades to all child records)

All routes support content negotiation:
  - `Accept: application/json`      → plain snake_case JSON (default)
  - `Accept: application/fhir+json` → FHIR R4 resource / Bundle

RBAC is enforced via require_permission() for the ("appointment", <action>) pair.

CRITICAL route ordering: GET /me must be registered BEFORE GET /{appointment_id}
to prevent FastAPI matching the literal string "me" as an integer path segment.
