EXAMPLE / reference resolvers — companion to
app/gql/types/patient_lazy_example.py. See that module's docstring for the
sub-resource-level mechanics (field-level lazy resolution, a
dependent/hierarchical nested resolver via resolvedOrganization) and its one
honest caveat (the core fetch below still calls `get_by_id()`/`list()`,
which already return every sub-resource array server-side — see that
docstring for why, and what a real fix would need).

This file holds TWO query fields that contrast the two shapes the same
lazy sub-resource resolvers behave in, depending on whether the parent ID is
already known or not:

  1. `patientLazy(patientId: ...)` — PURE PARALLEL. The caller already
     supplies the one thing every sub-resource resolver needs (`self.id`),
     as a query argument. So `name`, `identifier`, `telecom`, ... have
     nothing left to wait on and nothing they depend on each other for —
     graphql-core resolves all of them concurrently the moment they're
     selected together.

        query {
          patientLazy(patientId: 1) {
            id
            gender
            name { family given }
            generalPractitioner {
              referenceType
              referenceId
              resolvedOrganization { name }
            }
          }
        }

  2. `patientsLazy(...)` — DEPENDENT AT LIST SCALE. There is no single
     `patientId` argument here; the caller only knows filters (name,
     limit, offset). Each Patient's own `id` doesn't exist yet from the
     caller's point of view — it only becomes known once `service.list()`
     resolves and hands back that Patient's row. Every sub-resource
     resolver for *that* Patient object (still the exact same `name`/
     `identifier`/etc. methods on PatientLazyType — no new type needed)
     necessarily runs after its own parent Patient has resolved, since it
     reads that Patient's `self.id`. This is the scenario your boss is
     describing: fetching "all user data" means each patient's
     sub-resource fetches are gated behind that one patient's own ID
     coming back from the list first — a real parent → child dependency,
     repeated once per list item — not a single independent lookup like
     case 1.

        query {
          patientsLazy(limit: 5) {
            id
            name { family given }
            identifier { value }
          }
        }

     Two concurrency levels still apply here, both free/automatic:
       - Within one Patient, `name` and `identifier` are still siblings —
         concurrent with each other, exactly like case 1, once that
         Patient's id is known.
       - Across different Patients in the list, graphql-core resolves each
         list item's subtree independently too, so patient #1's `name`
         fetch and patient #2's `name` fetch also run concurrently with
         each other, not one-list-item-at-a-time.

     What this does NOT solve, and is worth flagging plainly: none of that
     concurrency collapses *repeated* calls. `patientsLazy(limit: 50) {
     name }` still fires `list_names()` once per patient — 50 separate
     fhir-server calls, just running concurrently rather than serially.
     That's the classic GraphQL N+1 problem. The standard fix is a
     `strawberry.dataloader.DataLoader` that batches same-tick `list_names`
     calls by patient id into one request — not implemented here since it
     wasn't asked for, but it's the natural next step once this list field
     sees real traffic.
