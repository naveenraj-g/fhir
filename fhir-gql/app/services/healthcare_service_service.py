"""
Business logic service for FHIR HealthcareService resources.

This service is the authoritative home for all business rules applied to
HealthcareService operations before they are forwarded to the fhir-server. It sits
between the API route handlers and HealthcareServiceClient, ensuring that:
  - PATCH requests with an empty payload are rejected early (422) instead of sending
    a no-op update to the fhir-server.
  - The caller's JWT subject (actor.sub) is stamped as created_by / updated_by on
    every write (the actual injection happens in FhirClient.post() / FhirClient.patch()).

The service never accesses the database directly; all persistence is delegated to
the fhir-server via HealthcareServiceClient.

Content negotiation:
    Each method accepts an optional `accept` parameter that is forwarded through
    HealthcareServiceClient to FhirClient as the HTTP Accept header. The fhir-server
    uses this to decide whether to return plain JSON or FHIR R4 format.
