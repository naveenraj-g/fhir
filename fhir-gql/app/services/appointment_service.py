"""
Business logic layer for the Appointment resource.

AppointmentService sits between the router and AppointmentClient. It owns:
  - Empty-patch rejection (422 if the caller sends an empty PATCH body)
  - /me lookup: returns a paginated list of the caller's appointments (Variant B)
  - /book: simplified booking flow — validates slot availability, creates the
    Appointment, marks the Slot busy, and rolls back if the slot update fails.

The service does NOT inject created_by or updated_by — FhirClient does that.
The service does NOT inject user_id or org_id — the caller supplies them in the
request body (optional, matching the fhir-server schema).

        Return a paginated list of Appointments belonging to the authenticated user (Variant B).

        Filters by `user_id=actor.sub` — the JWT subject is used as the user_id

        (status, start_from, start_to, limit, offset) are forwarded from MeAppointmentsSchema.

        This is Variant B (1-to-many) — a user can have many appointments, so
        the response is a full paginated envelope, not a single resource.

        Args:
            filters: Validated query parameters from the router (no user_id/org_id).
            actor:   Authenticated caller — JWT subject used as user_id filter.
            accept:  Content-type preference forwarded to the fhir-server.

            Paginated plain JSON or FHIR Bundle of the caller's Appointments.
