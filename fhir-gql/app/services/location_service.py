"""
Business logic service for FHIR Location resources.

This service is the authoritative home for all business rules applied to Location
operations before they are forwarded to the fhir-server. It sits between the API
route handlers and LocationClient, ensuring that:
  - PATCH requests with an empty payload are rejected early (422) instead of sending
    a no-op update to the fhir-server.
  - user_id and org_id (required by the fhir-server for tenant scoping) are supplied
    by the caller in the request body and forwarded as-is.
  - The caller's JWT subject (actor.sub) is stamped as created_by / updated_by on every
    write (the actual injection happens in FhirClient.post() / FhirClient.patch()).

The service never accesses the database directly; all persistence is delegated to
the fhir-server via LocationClient.

Content negotiation:
    Each method accepts an optional `accept` parameter that is forwarded through
    LocationClient to FhirClient as the HTTP Accept header. The fhir-server uses this
    to decide whether to return plain JSON or FHIR R4 format. Internal calls (e.g.
    any pre-check queries) must never forward `accept` — they always use plain JSON
    for programmatic inspection.
