"""
FHIR client for PractitionerRole resources.

Thin wrapper around the shared FhirClient that knows the fhir-server path.
No business logic lives here — all validation and rules belong in PractitionerRoleService.

A PractitionerRole describes the role that a Practitioner plays within an Organisation
at a given Location and/or for a set of HealthcareServices. It is the main record
used for appointment scheduling (via Schedule / Slot) and booking directory queries.
